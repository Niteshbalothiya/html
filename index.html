                <p  class="center">    Pizza is a popular Italian dish made of a round, flat dough base topped with sauce, cheese, and various ingredients like meats, vegetables, or herbs. It’s baked in an oven until the cheese melts and the crust becomes crispy. There are many types of pizza, like Margherita, which has just tomato sauce, cheese, and basil, or Pepperoni, which has spicy sausage slices. Pizza is loved for its delicious flavors and can be customized to suit different tastes</p>
